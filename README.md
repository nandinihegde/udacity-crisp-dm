This project is part of the submission for UDACITY CRISP-DM Project. The article explaining the project is available at:

The aim of is this analysis is to assess the Bookings trend and impact on airbnb bookings/sales during the covid lockdowns announced in early 2020 in comparison to the trends found during the same months in 2019.The scope is restricted to the City of Los-angeles.
The analysis is broken down into 2 parts.
Part-1 consists of exploratory data analysis on the Calendars dataset to explore the trend in bookings and revenue.
Part-2 explores the Listing datasets in conjuctions with the Calendars dataset to build a Machine learning model to identify the features that most affected bookings during these two years

The datasets are fairly large in size and could not be included in the repository but can be found on http://insideairbnb.com/
